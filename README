Coursera Downloader
-------------------

For downloading videos for Coursera classes. Given a class name and related cookie file, it scrapes the course listing page to get the week and class names, and then downloads the related videos into appropriately named files and directories.

Why did I do this?  Because I was using wget before, but I had the following
problems:
1. Video names have a number in them, but this does not correspond to the actual order.  Manually renaming them is a pain.
2. Using names from the syllabus page provides more informative names.
3. Using a wget in a forloop picks up extra videos which are not posted/linked, and these are sometimes duplicates.

Naming is somewhat verbose, so that it will display and sort properly using MX Video on my andriod phone.

Directions
----------

Requires Python 2.x (where x >= 5).

Tested on:
- Ubuntu/Python 2.6.5
- Win7/Python2.5 (Cygwin)

1. Install dependencies 
  1a. (Optionally) install "easy_install"
    Windows: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
    Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

  1b. Beautiful Soup 3 -- http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
    easy_install BeautifulSoup

  1c.  Argparse -- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse
    If Python version >= 2.7, this is a built-in
    easy_install argparse

2. Create a Coursera.org account and login
    e.g. http://saas-class.org

3. Locate or export your Netscape-style cookies file for authentication
    Chrome users can use "cookie.txt export" extension.
    https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lopabhfecdfhgogdbojmaicoicjekelh

4. Run the script to download the videos.
    e.g. coursera_dl.py -c cookies.txt saas

Troubleshooting
---------------

If it's finding 0 sections, you probably have a bad cookies file.
Use -l listing.html and then examine that file -- if it's the non-logged-in
page then this is definitely your problem.

Examples:
  coursera_dl.py -c cookies.txt saas
  coursera_dl.py -c cookies.txt -l listing.html -o saas --skip-download
