Coursera Downloader
-------------------

Coursera.org is creating some fantastic, free educational videos. This script
allows one to batch download videos for a Coursera class. Given a class name
and related cookie file, it scrapes the course listing page to get the week and
class names, and then downloads the related videos into appropriately named
files and directories.  

Why is this helpful?  Before I was using wget, but I had the following problems:

  1. Video names have a number in them, but this does not correspond to the
     actual order.  Manually renaming them is a pain.
  2. Using names from the syllabus page provides more informative names.
  3. Using a wget in a forloop picks up extra videos which are not posted/linked,
     and these are sometimes duplicates.

Naming is somewhat verbose, so that it will display and sort properly using MX
Video on my Andriod phone.

Inspired in part by youtube-dl (http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl) by which I've
downloaded many other good videos such those from Khan Academy.  


Directions
----------

Requires Python 2.x (where x >= 5) and a free Coursera account.

Tested on:
- Ubuntu/Python 2.6.5
- Win7/Python2.5 (Cygwin)

1. Install dependencies 

  1a. Beautiful Soup 3 -- http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
    Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python-beautifulsoup 
    Other*: easy_install BeautifulSoup

  1b.  Argparse -- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse
    Only need install if Python version < 2.7
    Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python-argparse
    Other*: easy_install argparse

  * To install "easy_install"
    Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    Windows: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

2. Create a Coursera.org account and login
    e.g. http://saas-class.org

3. Locate or export your Netscape-style cookies file for authentication
    Chrome users can use "cookie.txt export" extension.
    https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lopabhfecdfhgogdbojmaicoicjekelh

4. Run the script to download the videos.
    e.g. coursera-dl -c cookies.txt saas


Troubleshooting
---------------

If it's finding 0 sections, you probably have a bad cookies file.
Use -l listing.html and then examine that file -- if it's the non-logged-in
page then this is definitely your problem.

Examples:
  coursera-dl -c cookies.txt saas
  coursera-dl -c cookies.txt -l listing.html -o saas --skip-download
